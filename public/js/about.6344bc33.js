Our goal is to provide sneakerheads with rare gems from around the sneaker world. Some sneakers have become increasingly rare over time and sometimes coming across a pair nowadays is extremely difficult especially in the right size. The 1999-2004 era was one of the best sneaker releases in history in our opinion. All our prices listed are in US Dollars. This app is meant for people who want to find an alternative to buying, selling, or trading sneakers and rare kicks. To use this app you first have to signup, and post a listing for sale and link up with people in your local community to make the sale! Every listing must come with the original receipt for proof of authenticity. ")])])])])])}],r=a("2877"),n={},o=Object(r["a"])(n,i,s,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=o.exports}}]);
